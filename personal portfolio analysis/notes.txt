I want a summary tool -- that can show me multiple views:

retirement vs. brokerage

within retirement, I want to see how much is in 401k/ira type vs non-taxed roth style.

separately, I want a view that shows my equity vs. fixed income balance

I also want a table view that shows my entire exposure in every position, if I have multiple accounts holding a position, I want to see the total nad then when click on the line, show the composition in each account

I also want a view that sees the sector balance,  based on normal sectors

I want to be able to say I own X shares of this or that stock.

I want to know how my entire portfolio is balanced as far as domestic vs international vs bonds, looking at the actual composition of funds.
